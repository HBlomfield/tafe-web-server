# How to use
* download from the github
* import the .sql database
* change the const configSQL to values for your sql database (line 151)
* change the acceptedhost const to only allow requests from the server specified (line 68)
* ignore the site/config/ssl folders, they're a bit messed up but work on localhost and allow the https req/res to be used
